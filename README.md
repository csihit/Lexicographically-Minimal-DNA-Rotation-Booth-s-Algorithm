# Lexicographically-Minimal-DNA-Rotation-
Finding the lexicographically minimal rotation of a string is a classic problem. In DNA sequences, it helps with fast comparison and alignment. This snippet uses a variation of Booth’s Algorithm, adapted for a custom DNA alphabet. Efficient string processing like this is crucial in bioinformatics, computational biology, and data compression.
